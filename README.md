# Tech-Fair-Project-2020-2021
Tech Fair submission for Richard Yu and Kevin Yuan for 2020-2021. Digital Game Design category.

Requires Python, the program was made using Python 3.8.5, which can be downloaded at https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-385/.

Once Python is installed, go to the terminal and type "pip install pygame"


To run the game, open the file called main.py

Currently, you cannot change the button selected on the main menu screen.

Use the arrow keys to select the character; there is no difference other than appearance.

Use WASD to move and the mouse to aim.
